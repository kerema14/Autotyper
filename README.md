# Autotyper
hello
this is a python program to troll the typing test websites like 10fastfingers.com
you'll need to download the tesseract setup from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki and install it
you'll need to replace the file path in the python code with where u installed the tesseract
also u have to install bunch of python libraries by pip with cmd, u can copy paste it from the libraries.txt file
and you are good to go
